# pemp support quagga router 
  A modified version of Quagga routing daemon to support peering equilibirum multipath routing (http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/). This work is relied on release 0.99.23 of Quagga router and the idea of solving multipath interdomain routing with game theory approach proposed in [1]. Regarding the original source code, bgpd,ospfd,zebra and lib are the folders that have been modified to support the implementation of PEMP. PEMP is a coordination framework that allow peering ISP to communicate with each other while making peering routing decision. Enabling PEMP support on a BGP speaker router allow that router to modeling the interpeer (or interdomain) route decision as a routing game, and make path choice according to the equilibrium strategy profiles of the game.
