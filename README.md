# pemp_support_quagga
  A modified version of Quagga routing daemon to support peering equilibirum multipath routing (http://www.nongnu.org/quagga/). Based on the source code of Quagga release 0.99.23 which already support bgp multipath. Regarding the original source code, bgpd,ospfd,zebra and lib are the folders that have been modified to support the implementation of PEMP. PEMP is a coordination framework that allow peering ISP to communicate with each other while making peering routing decision. Enabling PEMP support on a BGP speaker router allow that router to modeling the interpeer (or interdomain) route decision as a routing game, and make path choice according to the equilibrium strategy profiles of the game.
